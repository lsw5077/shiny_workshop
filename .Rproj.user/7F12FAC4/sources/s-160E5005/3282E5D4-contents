Many course participants are interested in displaying spatial information in the form of interactive maps. For this assignment, we have created a draft version of an app that displays the spatial distribution of the largest cities (from a population size perspective) across the world. This app relies on Leaflet, a package within R that can be used together with Shiny to generate these interactive maps. Download the [Leaflet activity files](exampleApps/leafletActivity.zip) and open assignment_map.R to get started. 

The goal of this assignment is to improve this app. More specifically, we would like you to:

1. Add a [title](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.3.1/titlePanel.html) to this app

2. Add a [select input](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/selectInput.html) to allow users to subset only the cities that belong to a particular country

3. Add a [radio button](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/radioButtons.html) that allow users to subset only the capital cities.

4. Create a [side bar](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/sidebarLayout.html) that will collect all the input that we want from the user (e.g., minimum population size and desired country)

 ***Bonus challenges!  If you get through the first four challenges, tackle these in the order you find them most interesting***

5. Add the [global May 2020 Normalized difference vegetation index](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MOD_NDVI_M) raster file (NDVI_lite.tif) to the leaflet map to visualize global "greenness." Visualize the variation in vegetation distribution using the ```r_colors``` palette created at the top of the script. If you get stuck, check out the [leaflet raster documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/raster.html).  

6. Add a legend for the NDVI raster

7. Try adding different [provider tiles](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/basemaps.html)

8. If you feel like a real data challenge, try swapping out the dropdown list for a [selectize](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/selectize.html) input and let users select multiple countries. 

9. What happens if a user chooses an invalid combination of filters (e.g., a capital city with too large of a population)? Come up with a way to prompt users to choose a valid filter combination.  

Once you make the changes described above, check your answers against assignment_map_solution.R. There are multiple ways to accomplish the challenges, so your solution might be different than ours!
