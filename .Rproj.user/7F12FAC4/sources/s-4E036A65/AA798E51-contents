Welcome everyone! Before we get going, let's make sure we have all the tools we need. First and foremost, make sure you have the most recent versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Next, let's install all the packages we're going to need. Copy and paste this code into a new script or your RStudio console and run it. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "shiny",
                   "leaflet",
                   "remotes",
                   "rfishbase"))

remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/wingspan')

```

If all of that ran and your packages are installed, we're good to go! If not, let one of us know and we'll help you out.
