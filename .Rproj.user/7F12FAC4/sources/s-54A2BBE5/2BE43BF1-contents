**Preparation**

Welcome everyone! Before we get going, let's make sure we have all the tools we need before the course starts. First and foremost, make sure you have the most recent versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Next, let's install all the packages we're going to need. Copy and paste this code into a new script or your RStudio console and run it. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# Install packages hosted on cran

install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "shiny",
                   "leaflet",
                   "remotes",
                   "rfishbase",
                   "viridis",
                   "adehabitatHR"))

# install the wingspan data package from github

remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/wingspan')

# install the colorblindr package from github for accessibility testing

remotes::install_github('clauswilke/colorblindr')

```

If all of that ran and your packages are installed, we're good to go! If not, let one of us know and we'll help you out.

**Course organization**

This course consists of 5 morning blocks spread throughout 5 weeks. The first 4 morning blocks will be organized in the following way:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

          data.frame(Time = c("Prior to event",
                                "09:00-11:00 EST",
                                "11:00-12:00 EST"),
                       Description = c("Watch pre-recorded lectures/coding sessions (these                                     videos are available in the corresponding module link)",
                                       "Group activity",
                                       "Wrap-up session")) %>%
                       kable() %>%
                       column_spec(2, width = "30em")

````

The last morning block will be used for participants to present the apps they have developed as part of this course.

During the group activities, we expect that all course participants will fully engage and participate in the different activities. More specifically, we request that participants treat virtual meetings the same they would have if they were traveling to Annapolis (e.g., block off the morning period, set an out-of-office email for the day, etc.). Furthermore, at the start of each activity, we strongly encourage everybody to keep their cameras on and avoid checking emails.

During the wrap-up session, we will summarize the main topic of the day and clarify the most common sources of confusion. This session will provide closure to the activities of the day and will help prepare participants for the activities in the following week.
