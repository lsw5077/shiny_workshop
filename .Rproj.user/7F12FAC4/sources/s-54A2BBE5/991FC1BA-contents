## Upon completion of this module, learners should be able to:

-	### Prepare a prototype of an interactive web application focused on their own work hosted on shinyapps.io
-	### Describe a wide range of uses for interactive web applications
- ### Upon completion of this course, we hope that learners will have had the opportunity to interact with several of the other course participants, ultimately having developed a network of peer Shiny app developers

For this module, we would like for each person or group to present their app. It is fine if the app is not up and running. In this case, course participants should describe how the app would look like and what would be its main features.

When presenting their app, we would like participants to follow the Structured Decision Making framework when making their presentation. 

Furthermore, it would be great if participants emphasized the best practices that they attempted to follow/implement. When presenting your app, make sure your app is hosted on shinyapps.io so that we can practice the whole workflow, even if there pieces that need to be improved. This is partly to make sure that we have provided all the information that you need so that you can put your app online without a problem.



Finally, please note that each presentation will be limited to 10 minutes to give enough time for everybody to present their app.
