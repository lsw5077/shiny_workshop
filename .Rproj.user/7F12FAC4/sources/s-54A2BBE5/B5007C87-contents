# Feedback exchange:

We strongly believe in peer learning and we think that this is an excellent opportunity to learn from each other. The goal of this activity will be to provide and receive constructive feedback on each otherâ€™s app. Notice that this feedback can refer to the best practices we described earlier but does not have to be limited to these best practices. We would like each group to initially focus on the conceptual aspects of the app to then provide feedback into the actual code. 

One way of doing this is to give everybody in the group 5 minutes to briefly present their app (or the idea for their app) while the other members of the group take notes. Once these presentations are over, then the group can go from app to app providing their comments in relation to the conceptual aspects of the app. On a second round, the group can go from app to app providing their comments regarding the code and how it is structured.

# Peer help:

Once the feedback exchange is over, you can use the remaining amount of time to provide or seek help from the other group members regarding your own app.
