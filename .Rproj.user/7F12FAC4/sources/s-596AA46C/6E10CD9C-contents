# Feedback exchange:

We strongly believe in peer learning and we think that this is an excellent opportunity to learn from each other. The goal of this activity will be to provide and receive constructive feedback on each otherâ€™s app. Notice that this feedback can refer to the best practices we described earlier but does not have to be limited to these best practices. We would like each group to initially focus on the conceptual aspects of the app to then provide feedback into the actual code.

One way of doing this is to give everybody in the group 5 minutes to briefly present their app (or the idea for their app) while the other members provide their comments in relation to the conceptual aspects of the app. On a second round, the group can go from app to app providing their comments regarding the code and how it is structured.

The main outcome from this activity should be a list of revisions to make in your own app. This activity will last for about one hour. As a result, make sure that you allocate your time well so that everybody has a chance to participate.

Finally, for this activity to be productive and inclusive, please remember that it is important to provide respectful and constructive feedback. Also, avoid being too hard on yourself. It is part of the learning process to make mistakes and constantly be working on improving your app.
