Many course participants are interested in displaying spatial information in the form of interactive maps. For this assignment, we have created a draft version of an app that displays the spatial distribution of the largest cities (from a population size perspective) across the world. This app relies on Leaflet, a package within R that can be used together with Shiny to generate these interactive maps. Download the [Leaflet activity files](exampleApps/leafletActivity.zip) and open assignment_map.R to get started. 

The goal of this assignment is to improve this app. More specifically, we would like you to:

1. Add a title to this app

2. Add a drop down list to allow users to subset only the cities that belong to a particular country

3. Add a radio button that allow users to subset only the capital cities.

4. Create a side bar that will collect all the input that we want from the user (e.g., minimum population size and desired country)

5. ***Bonus challenge!*** If you get through the first four challenges, add the [global May 2020 Normalized difference vegetation index](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MOD_NDVI_M) raster file (NDVI_lite.tif) to the leaflet map to visualize global "greenness." Visualize the variation in vegetation distribution using the ```r_colors``` palette created at the top of the script. If you get stuck, check out the [leaflet raster documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/raster.html).  

Once you make the changes described above, check your answers against assignment_map_solution.R. There are multiple ways to accomplish the challenges, so your solution might be different than ours!
