# Upon completion of this module, learners should be able to:

-	**Prepare a prototype of an interactive web application focused on their own work**
-	**Describe a wide range of uses for interactive web applications**

**Upon completion of this course, we hope that learners will have had the opportunity to interact with several of the other course participants, ultimately having developed a network of peer Shiny app developers**
