# Chapter 1. Introduction: invariants imply deeper symmetries

## 1.1 Introduction (with examples)

**Invariants:** characteristics that do not change in the life histories of plants and animals (no love for fungi and protists apparently)
  - Prospective: symmetry (when some traits of an object remain unchanged despite transformations) describes not only physical relationships but also relationships between concepts and life history traits
  
### Example 1: protygonous fish

![](images/lyretail.jpg). 

Anthias squamipinnis (lyretails) start as female, then become male as they grow. The largest 20-30 % of fish are always male, no matter what absolute size that 20-30 % actually are.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

data.frame(site = c(rep("big", 50), rep("small", 50)),
           male = c(rnorm(50, mean = 62, sd = 5),
                    rnorm(50, mean = 47, sd = 5)),
           female = c(rnorm(50, mean = 47, sd = 7),
                      rnorm(50, mean = 32, sd = 7))) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = female), color = "black", fill = "grey") +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = male), color = "black", fill = "black") +
  labs (x = "Standard length (mm)", y = "Number of fish") +
  theme_classic() +
  facet_wrap(~site, nrow = 2)

```

Fig 1.1: Males and females retain the same relative body size distribution regardless of their absolute body size.


```{r}

data.frame(x = seq(-4, 1, 0.1)) %>%
          mutate(y = 1.6 + 1.1*x) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  labs(x = "log instantaneous bird mortality rate", y = "log bird clutch size per year") +
  theme_classic()

```

Because mortality rate and clutch size per year are both on units of time, their ratio makes a dimensionless number. The ratio between clutch size and mortality rate is constant despite the magnitude of either value. Birds with a higher average mortality rate have larger clutch sizes, indicating that they are allocating more energy to reproduction than to survival.

```{r}

data.frame(x = seq(-1, 3, 0.1)) %>%
          mutate(y = 0.52 - x) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y)) +  
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = jitter(y, 5))) +
  labs(x = "log mammal age at maturity", y = "log mammal clutch size") +
  theme_classic()

```

Mammal clutch size per year decreases as mammal age ag maturity increases. This is also indicative of a tradeoff between investing in reproduction vs. survival. Mammals that take a long time to mature experience a high degree of parental care and much investment per offspring, compared to mammals that mature young and focus on producing lots of offspring. 

In general it is easier to identify tradeoffs like this than it is to assign a cause to them. The patterns we see in nature are the emergent outcomes of symetric and non-symetric processes. 

## 1.2 Population dynamics

- Processes may be either density dependent or density-independent
- Populations are characterized by changes in size and time

### Example: stable age distribution

- If a population is neither increasing or decreasing and has a monotonic likelihood of survival across life ages/stages, it can produce a stable age distribution, the number of individuals in each age class. SAD's rarely exist in the real world, but are a useful theoretical construct.

The expected distribution of ages $N_{a}$ should be described by:

$N_{a} = N_{0}(1-\mu)^{a}$

Where $N_{0}$ equals the number of age 0 individuals, $\mu$ is mortality rate, and $a$ is age.

```{r}

data.frame(Age = seq(0, 40)) %>%
  mutate(N = (40000*(1-0.2)^Age),
         propN = N/40000) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Age, y = propN), stat = "identity") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Age, y = propN), stat = "identity", color = "red", size = 2) +
  labs (x = "Age", y = "Proportion remaining") +
  theme_classic()

```

For stationary (stable in size) populations, the standard age distribution is equivalent to the mortality schedule. The reflection of mortality in standard age distributions gives us a way to quantify mortality in life histories.

## 1.3 Fitness and life history evolution 

- The rest of this book will assume stationary populations, which means it also assumes stabilizing selection. 

- The consequence of this assumption is that the ultimate evoultionary goal reduces to maximizing $R_{0}$, the intrinsic rate of increase. 

- If we're going to assume that populations are stable AND that individuals are competing to reproduce, then density dependence has to come in somewhere. 

- The ultimate outcome is that the book deals with populations at equilibriums, studying "statics" rather than eco-evolutionary dynamics. 

**Assumption: all density dependence is applied in juvenile survival, so the average population intrinsic rate of increase, $R_{0}$ can be described by:**  
<br />


$R_{0} = \int_{\alpha}^{\infty} L(x)b(x)dx$

<br />

Where $L(x)$ is the probability of surviving to age $x$, $\alpha$ is the age at maturity, and $b(x)$ is the birth rate. So the $R_{0}$ at any given age would be equal to the likelihood of surviving to that age multiplied by the reproductive output at that age. We can also write it as:

$R_{0} = S(\alpha)V(\alpha)$

or

$log_{e}R_{0} = log_{e}V(\alpha) + log_{e}S(\alpha)$

Let's break this down. We'll assume that instantaneous rate of mortality, $\mu$ is equal to 0.2 and age at maturity, $\alpha$ = 5. Lifetime likelihood of survival ($L(x)$) over ages x is defined by:

$L(x) = (1-\mu)^x$


```{r}

data.frame(x = seq(0, 40)) %>%
  mutate(Lx = 0.8^x) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = Lx), size = 2, color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = Lx), size = 3) +
  theme_classic()

```

And Let's say that reproduction is defined by a piecewise function where birth rate $b(x)$ before age 5 = 0 and the birth rate, $b(x)$, at ages 5 and up is 4:

```{r equation}
eq <-  noquote(paste(expression("x < 5, 0\\\\x >= 5, 4")))
```

$b(x) = \begin{cases} `r eq` \end{cases}$

```{r}

data.frame(x = seq(0, 40)) %>%
  mutate(bx = ifelse(x < 5, 0, 4)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = bx), size = 2, color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = bx), size = 3) +
  theme_classic()

```

So putting $L(x)$ and $b(x)$ together, we can estimate the change in $R_{0}$ over age as:

$R_{0} = L(x)b(x)$


```{r}

data.frame(x = seq(0, 40)) %>%
    mutate(Lx = 0.8^x,
           bx = ifelse(x < 5, 0, 4),
           R0 = Lx*bx) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = R0), size = 2, color = "red") +
    geom_point(aes(x = x, y = R0), size = 3) +
    theme_classic()

```

The definite integral calculates the area under the curve from 5, the age at maturity to infinity/maximum of age distribution. 

```{r}

R0 <- data.frame(x = seq(0, 40)) %>%
        mutate(Lx = 0.8^x,
               bx = ifelse(x < 5, 0, 4),
               R0 = Lx*bx) 

    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = x, y = R0), stat = "identity", data = R0) +
    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = R0), size = 2, color = "red", data = R0[R0$x > 4,]) +
    theme_classic()
    
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}

integrand <- function(x) {0.8^x*4}

## integrate the function from 0 to infinity

integrate(integrand, lower = 5, upper = Inf)[1]$value

# Ok, proof of concept. Let's integrate by parts

sum(R0$R0)

# Not exactly the same, but close enough for government work. 

```

$R_{0}$ can also be defined by:

$R_{0} = S(\alpha)V(\alpha)$

where $S(\alpha)$ is the chance of living to age $\alpha$ and $V(\alpha)$ is hte average number of daughters produced over a female's lifespan up to age $\alpha$. If we hold $R_{0}$ stable, than increasing $S(\alpha)$ will necessarily decrease $V(\alpha)$.

Equlibrium occurs when $\displaystyle \frac{\partial log_{e}R_{0}}{\partial \alpha} = 0$  

Creating the rule:

$\displaystyle \frac{\partial log_{e}V(\alpha)}{\partial \alpha} =    \displaystyle -\frac{\partial \log_{e}S}{\partial\alpha}$
 
i.e., positive changes in Survival as $\alpha$ increases equate to negative changes in S fecundity. Let $S(\alpha) = exp(-\phi(\alpha))$ so $log_{e}S(\alpha) = -\phi(\alpha)$ gives us an ESS:

$\displaystyle \frac{\partial log_{e}V(\alpha)}{\partial \alpha} =    \displaystyle \frac{\partial \phi(\alpha)} {\partial\alpha}$


The point of this whole discussion is to justify the use of $R_{0}$ as the fitness measure. The assumption that $R_{0} = 1$ means that populations are at equilibrium and creates a kind of finite currency that organisms must trade off against.
