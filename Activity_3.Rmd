### It's time to put our best practices to the test!

Download the [Crappie fish app](exampleApps/CrappieFishApp.zip) zip file and open the crappieFishApp/app.R. Run the app and examine the code. Discuss what the app does well and identify areas for improvement (there are a lot). The problems you identify could pertain to the app's appearence, performance, accessibility, and the style and organization of the code. Consider the best practices we have suggested and your own wealth of coding knowledge. 

Work with your group to brainstorm solutions to the problems you have identified. Describe in detail the changes you would make and how they will improve the app's form and function. Keep track of your changes in a google document, word document, or other note taking program.
